    <h3>Subject: Languages</h3>
    <p>I am currently a sophomore attending Staten Island Technical High School.
        I have many plans for the future and intend to follow through with them.
        One of my biggest goals is learning more languages.
        Language is a gateway into other people's cultures and offers many new exciting perspectives on ways different people live their lives.
        You could learn a language simply for the fun of it, or you may want to learn it for more job opportunities.
